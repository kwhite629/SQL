#For this project, I downloaded data on Spotify from Kaggle
#I then created a table to insert Spotify data into.
#I then used SQL to query the data

#Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL);


#I then inserted the Spotify data csv. into the table

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#I determined who the 10 artists were by popularity.
SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#I determined how many songs each artist had.
SELECT artist_name, COUNT((id))
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;

#I determined the top 10 artists for danceability. 
SELECT artist_name, avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY danceability desc
LIMIT 10;

#I determined the top 10 loudest songs.
SELECT track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY loudness desc
LIMIT 10;

#I determined the top 10 songs based on energy.
SELECT track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy desc
LIMIT 10;
