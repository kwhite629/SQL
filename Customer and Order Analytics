#In this SQL code, I am querying a database with multiple tables to analyze the data.


#1. How many orders were placed in January?

FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length (orderID)=6
AND orderID<>'Order ID'
AND orderID<>' '
AND orderID IS NOT NULL;


#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length (orderID)=6
AND orderID<>'Order ID';


#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
inner join BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON Feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE length (orderID)=6
AND orderID<>'Order ID'
AND orderID<>' '
AND orderID IS NOT NULL;


#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in(SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);



#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products)
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;


#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product, sum(Quantity), sum(Quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;


#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE feb.Quantity>2
